# Static store

This store can be:

- loaded by `json-server` to generate a mock REST API server
- loaded by global state and fed to app using the Context Provider
- used directly as mockup data in stateful components
- used directly in mock services as mockup data received
- ...

Mock data should make it easy to get going without relying on server!
